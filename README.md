# Terminator

A program designed to scan your network for connected hosts and return user details including IP address, PC name, Windows version and user name, then connect to a PC via WMI and view/terminate running processes.

Once the scan is complete you can connect to any PC using the IP address found via WMI. When the connection is made you can view all running processes on the PC and have the option to terminate the selected process.

*** Works in a lab environment running Windows Education (and possibly Pro) ***
